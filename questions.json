            "answer": "B",
            "reason": "Operator overloading in C# allows a class to define its own behavior for standard operators. This means you can redefine how operators like +, -, *, / etc. work for your custom types."

            "answer": "B",
            "reason": "An implicit conversion in C# happens automatically when the compiler can guarantee that there will be no data loss. For example, converting an int to a long can be done implicitly because a long can hold all possible values of an int."

            "answer": "B",
            "reason": "The 'as' operator in C# is used to safely cast to a type. If the cast is not possible, it returns null instead of throwing an exception."

A direct cast can change the actual type of the object.", "D. The 'as' operator returns null for an invalid cast while a direct cast throws an exception."],
            "answer": "D",
            "reason": "The 'as' operator differs from a direct cast in that it returns null if the cast is not possible, while a direct cast throws an InvalidCastException if the cast is not possible."

            "answer": "C",
            "reason": "Closing a Stream in .NET is crucial to prevent memory leaks and file locks. It ensures the proper release of resources and that any buffered data is written to the underlying storage."
